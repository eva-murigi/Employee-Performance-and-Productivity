# Employee-Performance-and-Productivity 
The goal of this project was to analyze employee performance and productivity using a dataset provided by Onyx Data. Leveraging Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key trends and insights, making it easy to identify high-performing teams, spot areas needing improvement, and refine engagement strategies. This dashboard provides a clear view of productivity metrics, supporting data-driven decisions for a more efficient and motivated workforce.

Informed decisions pave the way for stronger team dynamics and a happier workplace. This dashboard simplifies spotting trends, enhancing engagement, and refining performance strategies.
